# Custom Express API handler Template

<br>

A custom API handler template made by myself for all my future APIs and the community :)

<br>

## Features

- simple yet efficient; using [ESLint](https://npmjs.org/package/eslint), [categories](./src/routes/) to keep the code organized and clean.

- Database Support; supports [mongoose](https://npmjs.org/package/mongoose) by default, can be customized to support others

- Request Types; Handles all types of requests available in express, can be chosen from the route files itself
